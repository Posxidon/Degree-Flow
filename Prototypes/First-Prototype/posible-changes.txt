MES
* may not be able to use the logo for McMaster, we can sub the current logo for MES, or if we can include McMaster, include both

degree schedule appearance
* possibly change to drag and drop

ideas to simplify:
* drop down options: then a go to button, for the generate schedules, filtered courses, maybe saved schedules
* change degree progress to a drop down
* less roundedness
* changes transcript upload, maybe have it say the last upload

things to add: 
* show that generated is favourite schedules
* options to opt out of notifications
* options to look at other saved schedules
* options to look at favourited courses
