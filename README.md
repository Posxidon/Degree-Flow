# DegreeFlow

Welcome to **DegreeFlow**, an academic planning tool developed for McMaster University’s Faculty of Engineering. This web application provides students with tools to plan their academic journey, view degree requirements, receive alerts for open seats, and access personalized analytics — all while maintaining the privacy and security of their academic data.

##  Live Site

The application is hosted and available at:

**[https://degreeflow.macengsociety.ca](https://degreeflow.macengsociety.ca)**

No installation or setup is required. The site is live and ready to use.

##  Login Information

DegreeFlow uses **OAuth** for authentication and login. **No test credentials are required** to access the site.

Simply click on the **Login** button and sign in using any valid social account.

>  **Important Note:** While you can log in using any Google account, the **Transcript Upload** feature is restricted. It only works with official undergraduate transcripts from the **McMaster Faculty of Engineering**. All other formats will not be parsed successfully.

##  How to Test the Application

Once logged in, here are some key features you can explore:

-  **Degree Planner**: View and plan your course progression.
-  **GPA Analytics**: Get visual insights based on your academic history (only if transcript data is successfully uploaded).
-  **Seat Alerts**: Set alerts for open seats in desired courses.
-  **Transcript Upload**: This feature is only functional with a valid McMaster Engineering undergrad transcript PDF. If you don’t have one, you can still explore the rest of the application without uploading.
